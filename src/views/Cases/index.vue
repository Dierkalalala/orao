                                    Earlier Oracle platforms have understandably focused on financial data; mainly price
                                    feeds, due to technical limitations. However, if blockchain is to become mainstream
                                    in application, financial data is not enough.
                                </p>

                                    <b>ORAO</b> introduces Data Protocols, which enable a large variety of new data
                                    products for providers to sell. For example, by providing the outcome of a football
                                    match we can enable betting without involving a trusted third party. Smart contracts
                                    can be set up which query oracles after the end of a match to find out the outcome,
                                    then pay out accordingly to betters.
                                </p>

                                    Similarly, an insurance contract can insure a farmer against years of low
                                    precipitation - easy enough for a smart contract to query data providers and find
                                    out how many inches of rain have fallen between two dates in a particular region. If
                                    there has been a drought, payments can be made directly without delays for insurance
                                    company claims adjusters to inspect the farmer’s yields.

                                   <b>ORAO</b>’s approach leaves the door open for any number of new Data Protocols to be
                                    refined
                                    as well. By expanding out of financial data and into every niche Oracles can cover,
                                    we
                                    hope to build very large and disparate markets.
